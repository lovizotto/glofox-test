# glofox-test
Test for React Native

#Goods:
- Used DDD, Solid, etc (less on styles :P)
- Create a solution for stack navigation
- Used Context for state management solution
- Used typescript

#What are missing:
- I didn't use Redux, because I think sometimes it is overcoding and Context solve this problem.
- Split components (as I didn't focus on UI, I've not wasted time with that)
- Styles inline: Has a lot of different approachs to apply that, but as before, the focus wans't on UI
- tests (I should add tests, mainly because I did a Domain layer to do that, but sadly, I don't)
- I've not changed the Logo, icons, fonts etc.
